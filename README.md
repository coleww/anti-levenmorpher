# levenmorpher

A javascript function and command-line tool that morphs one word into another, one letter-change at a time.

It uses [a very liberal English word
list](https://www.npmjs.org/package/an-array-of-english-words). It might be
nice to use something less permissive to avoid really obscure words that
basically no one's ever heard of.  


```sh
npm i -g levenmorpher
morph good into evil
morph black to white
morph ruby node
```
